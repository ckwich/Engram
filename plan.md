# Engram — Persistent Semantic Memory for AI Agents

## Vision
A local-first MCP memory server that gives AI agents (Claude Code, Claude chat) genuinely useful long-term memory through semantic search, chunked retrieval, and token-efficient access patterns. Built to complement structured project documents (plan.md, AGENTS.md) — not replace them.

## Core Philosophy
- **Retrieve what's relevant, not everything.** Three-tier retrieval keeps token costs proportional to need.
- **Semantic search that actually works.** Local embeddings via sentence-transformers, not substring matching.
- **Human-readable backing store.** JSON files remain the source of truth; ChromaDB is the search index.
- **Complementary to structured docs.** Engram is fast operational memory; AGENTS.md/plan.md are canonical governance.

## Architecture

### Stack
- `sentence-transformers` — local embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, ~80MB, CPU-capable)
- `ChromaDB` — persistent vector store, no server required
- `FastMCP` — MCP server layer (stdio + SSE transport)
- `Flask` — web dashboard
- JSON flat files — human-readable memory backing store

### Storage Layout
```
engram/
├── data/
│   ├── memories/       # JSON flat files (one per memory, full content)
│   └── chroma/         # ChromaDB persistent vector index
├── core/
│   ├── embedder.py     # sentence-transformers wrapper
│   ├── chunker.py      # smart markdown-aware chunking
│   └── memory_manager.py
├── server.py           # FastMCP MCP server
├── webui.py            # Flask dashboard
├── install.py          # setup wizard
├── requirements.txt
├── AGENTS.md
└── plan.md
```

### Three-Tier Retrieval Pattern
```
search_memories(query)       → scored snippets only       [~50 tokens/result]
retrieve_chunk(key, chunk_id) → one relevant section      [~200 tokens]
retrieve_memory(key)         → full content               [full cost, intentional]
```

Agents should always start at tier 1 and escalate only when needed.

## Chunking Strategy
- Split on markdown headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) first
- Fall back to double-newline paragraph splits
- Max chunk size: 800 chars (tunable)
- Each chunk stored in ChromaDB with: `parent_key`, `chunk_id`, `chunk_index`, `title`, `tags`
- Chunk IDs: `{md5(key)}_{chunk_index}` for stable referencing

## v0.4 — Polish and Reliability (complete)

### Webui Fixes
- [x] Fix JSON serialization bug in dashboard edit/create form — special
      characters (backticks, dashes, angle brackets) in content field break
      JSON.parse on submit. Properly escape content before POST.
- [x] Remove hardcoded character limit on content textarea in the dashboard
      form — the 15K limit is enforced server-side, the UI shouldn't
      silently truncate or error before submission.

### Engram Protocol
- [ ] Add v0.4 section to AGENTS.md template with forward-slash key warning
      and 15K char guidance baked in as defaults

### Reliability
- [x] Add integration test: store → search → retrieve_chunk → delete cycle
      run against a live server instance (python server.py --self-test)
- [x] Add health check endpoint: GET /health returns server status, model
      load state, memory count, chunk count (webui.py + server.py --health)

## v0.5 — Agent-Native Tool Surface

- [x] Add `memory_protocol` discovery tool for the retrieval ladder, aliases, and warnings.
- [x] Add filtered `search_memories`, paginated `list_memories`, and `context_pack` for compact working sets.
- [x] Add verb-friendly aliases: `find_memories`, `read_chunk`, `read_memory`, and `write_memory`.
- [x] Add `prepare_memory` no-write draft gate before storing.
- [x] Add `audit_memory_metadata` and dry-run-first `repair_memory_metadata` for JSON metadata hygiene.
- [x] Preserve compatibility text wrappers while keeping structured tools canonical.

## v0.6 — Agent Operating Layer

- [x] Add progressive-discovery protocol groups for stable retrieval and beta expansion surfaces.
- [x] Add typed graph edge storage with evidence-first relationship traversal.
- [x] Add GraphStore persistence boundary so JSON graph data can migrate to a future graph DB backend.
- [x] Add graph MCP tools for edge listing, impact scans, and read-only audits.
- [x] Add source intake draft storage for transcripts, logs, scans, and handoffs.
- [x] Add source intake MCP tools for prepare/list/read/discard/promote flows.
- [x] Add context pack receipts so agents can see chunk selection and budget accounting.
- [x] Add token usage telemetry and a Token Lens dashboard for Engram-attributed estimates.
- [x] Add operation job/event seams for long-running import, scan, and maintenance workflows.
- [x] Add deterministic agent reliability harness for retrieval, budget, and token-estimate regression checks.
- [x] Add provider-neutral codebase mapping tools where the connected agent, not a hardcoded subprocess, performs synthesis.

## v0.7 — Retrieval Quality and Source Reviewability

- [x] Add named no-write ingestion pipelines for transcripts, code scans, design docs, handoffs, and generic sources.
- [x] Add chunk preview helpers and WebUI/API surfaces so agents can inspect chunk boundaries before storing.
- [x] Add preview-only local path source connector helpers that produce draft arguments without importing memory.
- [x] Add opt-in `retrieval_mode="hybrid"` for identifier-heavy queries while preserving semantic retrieval as default.
- [x] Add grounded citations to `context_pack` chunk output and receipts.
- [x] Add MCP/WebUI retrieval eval surfaces backed by the deterministic reliability harness.
- [x] Add static workflow templates for common agent flows such as repo resume, source decision extraction, brownfield mapping, and retrieval quality review.

## Engram 1.0 — Finish Line

Engram 1.0 is the public, generic, local-first memory substrate release. The separate collaboration product should build on Engram through stable adapters, not inside this repository.

Tracked planning docs:

- `docs/ENGRAM_1_0_RELEASE_SPEC.md` — binding Engram 1.0 scope, invariants, release tracks, and validation gate.
- `docs/ENGRAM_1_0_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — execution plan for finishing 1.0 in small, validated commits.
- `docs/ENGRAM_1_0_TRACK_0_AUDIT.md` — repo/branch hygiene audit and evidence.
- `docs/POST_1_COLLABORATION_PRODUCT_HANDOFF.md` — boundary handoff for the separate collaboration product.
- `docs/COLLABORATION_PRODUCT_PRD.md` — draft PRD for that separate product.

Current release tracks:

- [x] Track 0: repo and branch hygiene audit; local `main` has been fast-forwarded to the planning/audit branch.
- [ ] Track 1: freeze MCP/tool/data contracts, version identity, docstrings, README tables, and alias behavior.
- [ ] Track 2: prove storage rebuild, import/export, backup/repair, JSON-first/Chroma-second ordering, and graph audit readiness.
- [ ] Track 3: harden source intake, lifecycle metadata, stale exclusion, and explicit draft promotion.
- [ ] Track 4: finish WebUI 1.0 review/operations surfaces without turning the dashboard into the collaboration app.
- [ ] Track 5: expand agent reliability evaluation coverage for source intake, graph-aware context, stale exclusion, hybrid lookup, and codebase mapping.
- [ ] Track 6: publish release docs, checklist, migration notes, AGENTS.md updates, and public README 1.0 framing.

1.0 does not include multi-user workspaces, permissions, comments, assignments, mentions, or rich collaboration pages. Those belong to the separate collaboration product.

## Key Decisions
- **ChromaDB over SQLite FTS:** Real cosine similarity, not substring matching
- **JSON-first / Chroma-second storage:** JSON files are authoritative and portable; ChromaDB is a rebuildable semantic index.
- **Graph backend seam before graph DB:** Keep JSON graph edges local-first now, but isolate persistence behind GraphStore so a future graph database can import the same edge contract.
- **Local embeddings only:** No API cost, no privacy exposure, works offline
- **No automatic memory writes from agents:** Agents must explicitly call `store_memory`. No surprise writes.
- **Review helpers stay no-write:** Chunk preview, source connector preview, workflow templates, and pipeline listing must never promote active memories.
- **Hybrid retrieval is opt-in:** Exact lexical/identifier scoring is useful for code and game-dev symbols, but semantic mode remains the default to avoid unnecessary ranking drift.
- **Token-proportional retrieval:** Agents should prefer search snippets, chunks, and context packs before full memory reads.
- **Provider-neutral synthesis:** Codebase mapping prepares bounded context and source receipts; the connected agent performs synthesis.
